this repository contains projects from my university AI Lab, demonstrating practical applications of key machine learning algorithms. My work includes implementations of:
Statistical Analysis & Feature Selection
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Means Clustering
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Best First Search (BFS)
Linear Regression
These exercises have provided me with a solid foundation in supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and algorithmic search strategies.
